* http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Instructions are to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# OUTPUT
* Week4PeerGradedAssignOutput.txt - the data table of the average of the mean and std variables per subject per activity cleaned and analyzed from the Samsung Galaxy Repository.
